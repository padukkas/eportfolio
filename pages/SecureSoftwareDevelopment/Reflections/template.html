										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Secure Software Development module has been interactive, educational and informative. From my previous educational experiences, student have mainly learned theoretical rather than practical. During this module I got the opportunity to implement from the knowledge gathered during the course of the module through the weekly activities, collaborative discussions and assignments.</p>
									<p>During unit one and two we discuss waterfall and agile methodologies when developing software. This is an interesting unit since from my personal experience at my employment we transitioned from waterfall to agile approach. From what I learned agile is the future as it is flexible and allows for continuous integrations. One point I see as a disadvantage with agile in experience is that we get limited time to document as we are always working on the next item. </p>
									<p>While working on unit two I got the opportunity learn more on how to overcome cyber security attacks from inside. ISO/IEC Standard 27000 how employees can be managed in order to prevent cyber attacks from within. So, this shows us even if we protect our applications from bad actors from outside the company we always have to keep in mind about the bad actors within. Now that I am aware of these methods such as authentication, authenticity, access control and etc. I will be having a conversation with my employers’ cyber security team to ensure we have these prevention methods enabled.</p>
									<p>During unit three the Codio activity to explore buffer overflow taught to verify for user input validations such as length of the allowed user input characters in relation to buffers boundary. So, in order to protect the applications against buffer overflow attacks is to add user input validations so it ensures the entered data is in line with the buffers boundary and not attempting to write the data to the buffer overwriting adjacent memory locations. Now learning about this method of attack in the future I will be adding input validations.</p>
									<p>Unit four the learnings of regular expressions and recursions was really interesting for me, I have used some regular expressions and recursions previously but never considered the system security when developing. During this unit I got to gather more in-depth knowledge regarding regular expressions specially regarding regex and ReDoS attacks. I have a developed an application to verify UK postal codes are verified properly. I have added a verification to ensure only the characters that are expected in that position of the postal code is accepted to avoid any evil regex attack.</p>	
									<p>In unit five we discussed testing; this is what I do on a daily basis as an Automation Engineer in Test Automation. This unit made me think about adding security testing to my test plans at work as my main focus has been regression, load and availability testing. But adding security testing in line with industry standards such as OWASP and ISO/IEC will broaden the scope and also put the teams mind at ease regarding security during releases. </p>
									<p>Unit six, we submitted the design document for the final product. There are lot of take aways from this group project. There are certain commitments that are in the design document that we might not able to complete due to lack of time and resources. I learned that we have to manage expectations of the group as well as the customer during this process. </p>
									<p>Unit six also went over using Linters as a code analysis tool to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and etc. This tool is very useful when developing code as a team as it allows the team to set rules on what are errors and which once are acceptable. I will be using in future project to implement rules in order to catch errors in the code. </p>
									<p>During the unit seven, we go over ontology which is a representation, naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations between data, and entities that are included in the project. This helps anyone to visualize the overview of the project easily. Going forward I will be using an ontology to present and document the overview of the project. </p>
									<p>Unit eight goes over cryptography and using it in operating systems. Cryptographic libraries are there to deal with cryptography algorithms and to have an API’s that will call the supported features. I have not had any previous knowledge in this arena. But in the hands-on Codio exercise I developed a function to take in a file which will then get encrypted after which the contents of that file will now be decrypted. For this functionality I take use of the fernet encryption algorithm which uses a 256 bits key to encrypt and produces a token which has the message in a way that it cannot be read or altered without the key. The code is included in the e-portfolio. Also, during this unit, we discuss TrueCrypt which is a discontinued utility used for on-the-fly encryption on operating systems. I think during the discussion all the students had similar suggestions for alternatives.</p>
									<p>During unit nine worked on learning about APIs. I think when it comes to development of APIs, we should always keep in mind security and not just how the API will function. Because the API will have access to data and functionality. So, we need to protect how to the data is being handled when the using that API. When I work with APIs, I will use TLS (transport layer security) to ensure the data is encrypted when in transit, include data validations and these are just some examples.  </p>
									<p>Faceted data was something I was not that familiar with before, but from what I understand it allows to protect systems from data leakages by only containing functional units, which are independent of the data which makes them isolated so not even the developer will have access to the data.</p>
									<p>The outcome of the final project was excellent. Even though we were missing some functionality from the design document, I think our team did an amazing job getting the work done. A take away for me is that when working with a team we have to manage expectations as well make sure all the teammates are on the same page in terms of commitments.</p>
									<p>All in all, this course was really beneficial to me in terms of knowledge and experience gathered. I have also attached all the work completed throughout the course in my e-portfolio.</p>
