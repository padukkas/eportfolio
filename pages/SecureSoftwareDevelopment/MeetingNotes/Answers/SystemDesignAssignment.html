										<h2>Evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. The design proposal (Unit 6)</h2>
									</header>
									<p><b><u>Question:</u></b></p>
									<p>Your evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. the design proposal (Unit 6), highlighting any differences with justifications for any changes/ omissions. That is, does the software meet the specification? Are there any omissions or changes to the implementation from the design? You can discuss this section as a team but will need to justify your answers.
                                    </p>
									<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b></p>

									<p>The design proposal was theoretical primarily. The ideas those were presented at the time would have been possible with more resources/man power in my opinion. But we were able to get most of the planned architecture implemented on time.</p>
										<p>From the use case that was delivered during the design proposal we had to omit the multiple adapters we had, auto scalability and the GUI. </p>
										<p>The reasons for omitting the multiple adapters were because simply because one adapter was sufficient to prove the proof of concept, auto scalability was removed because Docker Compose does not provide the support to auto scale, however there is an alternative solution which requires to use Kubernetes to auto scale. The full GUI component of the application was partially implemented but was not integrated with the back end, however there is a simple GUI which allows the user to the login and register to the application. RabbitMQ encryption was not implemented due to the lack of time and resources. The requirement to get MySQL’s logs directly to Logstash had to be omitted because the implementation of the connection to the ELK stack suffered from a configuration issue that made it unstable. From what was discovered it was not possible to connect MySQL directly to Logstash. RabbitMQ logs suffered from the same issues as the MySQL’s logs therefore the implantation was omitted.</p>
										<p>I believe we successfully completed the project mostly in line with the design proposal.</p>
