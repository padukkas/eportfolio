										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Object-oriented Information Systems module has been really interesting. I have learned about these methodologies in school but when working we do not actively pay attention to each methodology and it just gets applied in the code. 
										During this module I got the opportunity to develop code, draw out class diagrams and object diagrams with object-oriented methodologies in mind.</p>
									<p>Today I refreshed my knowledge on fundamentals of object-oriented design such as classes, objects, class function, class methods and inheritance. Since graduating I have not drawn an object diagram so in this unit, I drew an object model for a supermarket. Also refreshed my python skills by going over the Codio assessments. 
										I learned about the complexity of planning and drawing an object model diagram as we have to always approach it with the bigger picture of the application and the architecture of the code itself. I also learned about python property decorator for getters and setters which I was not familiar with before. 
										One of the struggles I was having with inheritance was that it creates a dependency between the child and parent class. When a class inherits from another class it exposes the parent class to the child class hence breaking encapsulation. But going forward I will have a better understanding of using inheritance effectively.</p>
									<p>I went over the different object diagrams other students have developed. Everyone had different takes on what objects were included and what was not included. However, it was interesting to see an individual not have the payment object as its own individual object. 
										In my approach I had payment method as a parent object and types of payments inheriting from payment method object.</p>
									<p>Today I learned about UML diagram designs. UML diagrams define a way to visualize the system has been designed and also assists in capturing use cases. We got to design a class diagram for an online shopping tool, this helped to learn further about UML diagrams. 
										During this I learned that when designing a class diagram, we have to keep in mind the use case and the flow of the application. This assisted me in designing and including the attributes as well as the functions effectively. During the design process we also have to include the relationship between the classes.</p>
									<p>During this unit I learned about database design principles and how to correctly normalize a database. This is something I personally have not used in the office environment. While going over the lecture cast it helped me understand better as they are comparing Entities, Attributes and Relationships to object-oriented terms. 
										The lecture cast also assisted in understanding how to use primary keys and foreign keys correctly by showing and explaining the given example. Normalization was an area where I did not have a clear understanding of going into this week’s unit but now, I have a better understanding on how to perform a normalization creating 
										normal forms 1NF, 2NF and 3NF by structuring and organizing the data eliminating redundancy and prevent introducing anomalies into the data, corrupting it. The set theory and notations used was a good refresher. This week’s practice on creating an ERD diagram put my learnings about normalization to the test by designing a ERD diagram. 
										According to the feedback of the professor I was on the correct path with my approach.</p>	
									<p>During the week 7 Mid Module Assignment: System Design assignment I designed a class and object diagram. I made a couple of mistakes around the notations that were later mentioned by the professor in the review of the assignment. I thought my grade (59%) would be higher than what I achieved but the mistakes I made are now clear to me, but this outcome brought me down a bit.</p>
									<p>During unit 8, I got the opportunity to put database design principles and practice the skills and knowledge. During the lecture we went over normalization, considerations when choosing tables and columns for the normalized data from 1NF, 2NF and 3NF and used the course table as an example to be normalized. 
										During this unit we had a collaborative discussion regarding alternatives to SQL to which I used Key Value stores since I have used it previously for a personal project. While going over other students’ discussions I learned that NoSQL databases such as MongoDB do support multi document transactions, which I was not aware of previously, 
										this is a good take away as this was a main reason, some people did not want to use NoSQL databases in their projects.</p>
									<p>During unit 9, I was able to refresh my memory about implementing databases with SQL. In the lecture cast I was able to learn about the DESCRIBE command which takes the name of the able as an argument. I was familiar with Data types in SQL but in the date data type it was a reminder about the date stamp format. 
										The example on adding primary key and foreign key when creating a table changed my approach when working with databases to assign foreign and primary keys when I initially create the tables. One of my weaknesses when using SQL is subqueries and joins. I have struggled on when to choose an inner join, left join or a left outer join etc.</p>
									<p>In this unit I learned about web development in python. The concept of Model-View-Controller is familiar to me as I work with unit tests which test the view model. The micro web framework was totally a new concept to me, after doing some research this is a technology I would like to use in a personal project of mine. 
										The malicious code injection was a really interesting topic as I got the opportunity to sit with a penetration tester while they were testing an application at my current company and SQL injection, cross site scripting are methods they used, during this unit I was able to get a better understanding of how these methods are used to do harm to applications. 
										The mitigation steps such as escaping input is a new concept to me which I will have to apply in the real world. During this unit I submitted the system implementation assignment, this assignment helped me understand python and object-oriented programming better.</p>
									<p>In this unit I got the opportunity to research more about the future of information systems. One of the most interesting findings was around privacy. In my opinion the right to privacy is just a piece of mind that we all like to imagine we have. In reality with all the new technology I believe there is no privacy.</p>
