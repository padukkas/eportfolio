										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
										<p>This was a module was really informational and knowledgeable, it has expanded my knowledge immensely.</p>
										<p>Working as a group has been beneficial to develop my self further in terms of listening to others opinions, sticking to commitments and helping one another succeed. During this module we as a team has worked alongside each other to get work/projects completed successfully in a timely manner. We all played an integral part in the success of the projects we completed.</p>
										<p>Throughout the module we had collaborative discussions which helped me see other opinions on the same subjects. I was able to give my opinion on each of the discussions and also replied to a couple of posts by other students stating my opinion in the matter. I think when we discuss and collaborate with each other it really expands our knowledge. For example, one student for the discussion one was explaining the points where we can increase the effectiveness of training, which I did not consider before, but now going forward during security reviews at my current company I will be bring these points up in methods of training the team. I always make sure to contribute to these conversations by providing my opinion to the best of my knowledge.  </p>
										<p>For the presentation that we had during the module, we worked as a team. But we divided the work so when putting the presentation together we would all do our own chosen slides. I contributed to these presentations by helping with adding my own content related to the topic in to the presentation deck and presenting the entire presentation most of the time during the lecture. Also, after the presentation I was able to answer the question other classmates or professor had along with my teammates.</p>
										<p>The practical team activities were carried out as a team, however I contributed to these activities by running individual tests to ensure the outputs other team members found are accurate and both our results are in sync with each other.  Carrying out my own tests helped me learn about tools such as WHOIS, nslookup, trace rout, dig and etc. Learning about these tools will be useful for me to perform similar tasks in the future. </p>
										<p>For the Design Document (Unit 6) we worked as a team to achieve the end result but I personally contributed in defining the recommendations and potential mitigations solutions, worked on making smaller changes to tools used portion after discussing with the team. At the end of the project, we were struggling to bring the word count down, so my self and the team worked together to reduce the word count by removing certain unwanted content from the document, which also allowed me to revise the contributions from other team members. </p>
										<p>During the development of Executive Summary (Unit 11) again we worked as a team to achieve the end result but I personally contributed in defining the recommendations and potential mitigations solutions, re testing in order to verify the assessment from Ahmed on results of scanning/exploiting target vulnerabilities and also I worked on the fixes after receiving the feedback from the professor to make some changes to the document to improve the outcome. When revising and retesting some of the work done by other team members in terms of testing for vulnerabilities our results were in sync with each other but I did my own tests to make sure we did not miss anything. </p>
										<p>In my personal opinion the development of the Executive Summary (Unit 11) was more hands on, when it was time to perform vulnerability tests against the assigned website. The Design Document (Unit 6) was highlighting what we will be doing during unit 11. I believe most of the points we committed in the design document was delivered in the final submission in unit 11. For example, in the Design Document we committed to completing a full penetration testing and during the Executive Summary we have completed the penetration tests to which we have attached the results of said tests in the submission.</p>
										<p>I personally saw a noticeable difference in the team dynamic after the design document, I believe that attributed to getting to know each other in a working environment where we were held accountable for our work, which I think helped us to succeed.</p>
										<p>My take away from these projects is the wealth of knowledge gathered when performing penetration and vulnerability tests, the different tools that was used, different testing approaches are just some of the main take aways. I also believe it is better to make clear commitments and deadlines.</p>
										<p>The learnings from this module will help me personally and professionally, performing penetration tests, using Khali Linux, TCP/IP, ISO/OSI 7-layer models, team work and many more topics. I personally did not have much knowledge in some of the topics I have mentioned above but this module helped me gather that knowledge.</p>
										<p>All in all, this was a great and successful module in my opinion which taught us about Networking and Security Management </p>
