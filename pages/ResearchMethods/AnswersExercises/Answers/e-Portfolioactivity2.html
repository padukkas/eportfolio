									<p>Question: Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

									</p>
										<p></p>

									<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

									<p>Every human has a desire for communication, which can be considered as one of the basic rights. As a result of that, we can spot a rise in novel inventions and trends that support communication across time. Additionally, the development of various online social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and others was made possible by the revolution and advancement of information technology, enabling us to engage in social interaction on a global scale without ever leaving the comfort of our homes. </p>
									<p>As a result of social networks exchanging personal information, this has alarmed many social platform users' regarding their privacy concerns, raising numerous social and ethical issues. Although all these online social networks have privacy terms, policies, and concerns, users have been able to understand that these networks do not have complete control over preventing the disclosure of users' sensitive information to unauthorized parties.  </p>
									<p>“Cambridge Analytica” being a political consulting firm that was established in 2013 which promotes various combinations of forecasted data and analytics using behavioral science on covertly obtained user data from Facebook, is responsible for its own actions from handling and collecting private user data to third party involvements. This results in developing a gap between gaining the trust of customers and simultaneously managing business operations.</p>
									<p>The fundamental issue here is that, while being a user-centered platform, Facebook does not have a right to gather and sell personal data to other parties to carry out targeted advertising. This practice is certainly not in line with proper disclosures and data privacy policies and certainly not in line with legal and professional standards. </p>
									<p>In collaboration with Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica developed the paid personality test called, "myPersonality" which was available through Kogan's app named, "This Is My Digital Life." To access this quiz-based test, users must sign into their Facebook accounts. The initial distribution of this personality test among thousands of people via an insecure website led to the widespread exposure of the gathered confidential information of millions of Facebook users to multiple unreliable third parties. (Waterfield and Revel, 2018). </p>
									<p>When the data breach became public, it was revealed that the organization had obtained data from individuals who had consented to give their confidential information for the personality test and on top of that, from their Facebook friends and followers beyond their understanding or approval breaching not just legal, but moral and ethical standards. Here, by gaining access to these nearly 87 million Facebook users and their friends' confidential information like, gender, age, appearance, liked posts, comments and friend lists and groups, interests etc. they have been able to predict most of these users' political beliefs and interests relying on those unlawfully harvested data.</p>
									<p>Therefore, undoubtedly Cambridge Analytica succeeded in persuading and motivating selected users to make use of their votes to elect Donald Trump as the 45th president of the USA by the application of micro-targeting (Grassegger and Krogerus, 2017).  </p>
									<p>After enduring multiple court proceedings and appealing, Facebook finally agreed to pay the demanded $643,000 compensation in October 2018 for its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica data breach, which involved the misuse of users' confidential information for political gain. In order to regain the trust of their consumers, they also agreed to implement changes to their privacy regulations that would limit the data that different app developers can view and obtain. </p>
									<p>However, back in 2021 Facebook again faced a controversial privacy breach incident which questions their renewed privacy policies and guarantees which were made after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (Maina, 2021) </p>
									<p>The theft of data from half a billion of its users through random questionnaires was the subject of this latest incident. Personal information about the users, such as their full names, phone numbers, and email addresses, was also obtained. The data was subsequently uploaded by the hackers for public viewing and free usage. </p>
									<p>Facebook promised to stop widespread data-scraping after the revealed. However, Cambridge Analytica used millions of its users' data to target voters with political advertisements during the 2016 elections.  </p>
									<p>This latest controversy makes Facebook's reliability questionable. It makes people wonder if they can trust Facebook and give Steve Wozniak's words serious thought. This latest controversy only serves to highlight how utterly ineffective all current methods of accountability have been and remain. (Maina, 2021) </p>
									<p>In the past few years, privacy violations have grown far too frequent, not just accelerating legal and professional concerns but also social and ethical concerns as well. Along with Facebook, other internet firms have also been targeted by hackers, including eBay, Linked In, and Adobe. </p>
									<p>Individuals commonly create an account for respectable platforms like Facebook with the understanding that their content is secure and will not be utilized arbitrarily. However, when individuals learn that their sensitive data has been exposed and misused, it is a grave violation of trust and privacy. Social networking sites ought to take the lead and warn their customers so that they are vigilant and constantly on the alert for online attacks that could utilize their confidential information fraudulently. (Maina, 2021) </p>
									<p>In conclusion, when we analyze all the above explained information concerning inappropriate use of surveys and collected data breaches, it is far more evident that even though most of these surveys and questionnaires seems innocuous they are indeed obnoxious. Therefore, prior to clicking any button all social media users must think twice when sharing their personal opinions and interests in public polls, surveys or even in simple quizzes.  </p>
