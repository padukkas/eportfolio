										<h2>Reflective activity - Ethics in Computing</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Question: Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take</p>
									<p></p>

									<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

									<p>Every action has a reaction, and every such reaction is a result of a choice which was made. Therefore, making a choice plays a significant role when it comes to the final output. As emotional beings, our every choice, movement and action are followed by emotions. There is no difference when it comes to the technological world. Therefore, as in our everyday life, in the technological world, it is crucial to be concerned about computer-related relationships, interactions and related emotions while analyzing the core component behind every such technical choice; which is, “ethics in computing.” As a result of today's technological work and learning environments, issues relating to privacy, ownership, surveillance, and autonomy has accelerated to a point where ethical issues are being practiced through ethical theories, policies, and even with ethical codes of conduct. Therefore, a computing professional is bound by many ethical concerns when deciding on their digital choices and related work.  </p>
									<p>From “writing specifications for new computer systems, testing and validating software systems, restructuring the back-end database of an inventory system, analyzing packet traffic in a local area network to advising security policies for medical information systems” many of these tasks are performed by computing professionals. Computing professionals have a responsibility to carry out these duties with diligence since their choices have an impact on the functionality and performance of computer systems, which in turn has an impact on both the welfare of the users of the systems directly and that of other persons indirectly.  </p>
									<p>When we referred to the “Stahl et al (2016) paper” the authors states that, “Many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.” This statement highlights that having a sound understanding of the applicability of computer-related ethical theories is essential for relevant professionals who are working in the technological fields.  </p>
									<p>As to the content of the referred paper, it is crucial for software engineers, data scientists and professionals to concentrate on the technical choices, social values, procedures, and practices, which holds a strong influence on ethical consequences relating to their designated titles in order to ensure computing standards. </p>
									<p>It is far more evident that a deeper understanding of these ethical issues and theories along with their connections are essential to implement remedies and advice for relevant stakeholders concerning related ethical issues.  </p>
									<p>“Privacy” as one of the key ethical concerns, plays a major role when it comes to technology and related platforms. When we consider computer ethics as a whole, privacy can be subdivided into two categories namely, “data privacy” and “personal privacy.” Here, data privacy can be interpreted as information about oneself, for which it is possible to specify appropriate standards of authoring, movement, and alteration; while personal privacy includes privacy protections that do not specifically address data about an individual, like the "right to be left alone" and the boundaries between "public" and "private" settings and spaces. </p>
									<p>Secondly when we consider “Professionalism" here, the key concerning factor which draws attention towards ethics is the accountability towards the community at large. This can be highlighted through the following statement. </p>
									<p>“Attention to ethics is an underlying justification for granting professional status” -Mostaghimi and Crotty- </p>
									<p>When we analyze the aforementioned statement with other related literature on professionalism, many studies express the link between professionalism and ethics of computing with reference to numerous codes of conduct. This indicates the value of a proper code of conduct available for computing professionals to refer ethical concerns relating to Information technology. Therefore, it is clear that professionals should make their choices not just based on digital aspects but also paying attention towards protecting privacy concerns to avoid harm, which can be done with the guide of a well-structured code of conduct. </p>
									<p>Self- governance, which technically known as “Autonomy” is about having control over one's own data, leads to a plethora of ethical concerns. Accordingly, this issue touches on a theoretical aspect and is in connection with issues like privacy and identity concerns. Here, a computing professional must follow relevant self-governing methods without abandoning privacy issues and related concerns. </p>
									<p>When we consider the issue of “Agency,” this can be brief as “Being able to conduct something that counts as an act or action,". The only time that anyone or anything qualifies as an agent is when they are able to perform actions. As a result of that, agency and autonomy are closely related. The competence of the agent must include the capacity to choose the course of action that will underpin its actions; as a result, the agent must exhibit a certain degree of autonomy. If we were to investigate further, a questionable issue may arise relating to artifacts like robots and other artificial intelligence systems and moral concerns; whether these autonomous artifacts can understand morals? Will they be able to act as agents with the ability of moral decision making? Likewise numerous ethical issues may arise. Further, “Trust” and “Consent” both of these issues are connected to privacy and autonomy. Likewise, most of these ethical issues are interconnected. </p>
									<p>An expert can be held morally responsible both for acting and for failing to act. As for an example, a hardware engineer might notice a design flaw that could result in a severe electrical shock to someone who opens a personal computer system unit to replace a memory chip. Even if the engineer is not specifically assigned to check the electrical safety of the system unit, the engineer is morally responsible for calling attention to the design flaw, and the engineer can be held accountable for failing to act. Therefore, computing professionals must balance all the aforementioned aspects of these issues in order to make positive and practical digital decisions while working on cyberspace. </p>
									<p>In conclusion, it can be stated that computer technology has created a completely new set of moral conundrums while affecting how the business sector must think about moral choices, from cybercrime to cybersecurity to the influence of computer specialists. Yet, due to the absence of a unifying, pro-ethical force in the global industry, it is far more challenging to establish strong moral norms of conduct for using computers and adhere to them consistently, considering how rapidly technologies advance. It is unquestionable that there are numerous gray areas relating to these ethical concerns; most of the time the users tend to point the fingers or put the blame on computers and other related devices yet, at the end of the day people are the creators of these devices and networking systems. Therefore, as computer professionals it is crucial to have a sound understanding of technology and the consequences of related digital choices and their ethical and moral repercussions.  </p>
