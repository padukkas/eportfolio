									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Research Methods and Professional Practice module has been interactive, educational and informative. From my previous educational experiences, student have mainly learned theoretical rather than practical. During this module I got the opportunity to implement some of the things we learn in the module to my units’ assignments.</p>
									<p><b>Unit one</b></p>
									<p>During the unit one for the initial post, I discussed about the Abusive Workplace Behavior that takes place. It was eye opening to me since we may accidently do some nonverbal action that might be taken as bullying or harassment. Unknowingly we might do a body movement or make a facial expression which might be interpreted in the wrong way. So, we really have to careful the way we behave not just in the work place but any public place.</p>
									<p>I also completed the Reasoning Quiz along with the reflective activity regarding ethics in computing which is posted in my e-portfolio.</p>
									<p>During the seminar I learned about the Inductive/Deductive research methods, which I was not that familiar with. </p>
									<p>Also started to look for a topic for my literature review and presentation.</p>
									<p><b>Unit two</b></p>
									<p>In unit two I responded to two of my peers’ initial posts. It is interesting see different view points others have on some on the same topic. But we all agree that work place abuse should always be reported.</p>
									<p>During the seminar we went over different research methods and practice. As a software engineer, I don’t get to perform researches to the extent we learn in this module. I perform research and development which does not go this in depth.</p>
									<p><b>Unit three</b></p>
									<p>During unit three I posted the summary post regarding the Abusive Workplace Behavior after going over the posts done by my peers, which showed me how important it is to act properly, keep in mind about other feelings and to report abusive behavior in the workplace. One conclusion I came to while writing the summary post was that companies need a board of people to enforce the code of conduct.</p>
									<p>During the seminar I learned why ethics are really important mainly for when collecting qualitative data. How to protect data especially sensitive data and getting permissions from individuals before disclosing (GDPR).</p>
									<p><b>Unit four</b></p>
									<p>For this unit I handed over the literature review outline to the professor to review. </p>	
									<p>I continued to work on the skeleton of literature review so that once I get the review from the professor, I can improve on what I was missing. </p>
									<p>In this unit I learned about using tools to perform quantitative methods and how to interpret statistical data.</p>	
									<p><b>Unit five</b></p>
									<p>In this unit we focused on survey methods. </p>
									<p>I also completed the reflective activity two which was focusing on the inappropriate use of surveys where the base study was Cambridge Analytica. Finding a similar case where I could compare was really hard, I spent a lot of time on google trying to find a such case and finally found one and did the comparison which I posted on my e-portfolio.</p>
									<p>Got the feedback from the professor, it was really detailed and I thought of changing some of the skeleton I had to match some of her suggestions. </p>
									<p><b>Unit six</b></p>
									<p>During this unit I learned different methods of obtaining responses for my graduation project as it will require me to do a proposal. </p>
									<p>I continued to finish up my literature review, with work and other module that I am taking time is of essence.</p>
									<p><b>Unit seven</b></p>
									<p>During this unit I posted my initial post for the discussion two which was addressing legal, social, and professional impacts of choices made by the researcher Abi.</p>
									<p>I completed and submitted the literature review on time and I think I was able to meet all the suggestions recommended by the professor during the review.</p>
									<p>The lecture case for this unit was useful to learn how valid the data we collect is.</p>
									<p><b>Unit eight</b></p>
									<p>For this unit I posted two replies to my peers, it again showed how important it is for scientific research to present the truth. </p>
									<p>I also worked on and completed the mandatory worksheet activities for unit eight, which I posted on my e-portfolio, I used the excel tool to complete these exercises. This hands-on activity was really useful for my personal and my career as learning formulas, formatting and general excel usage is always helpful.</p>
									<p>I started working on the research proposal presentation. For this presentation I picked the same topic I used for the Literature review. </p>
									<p><b>Unit nine</b></p>
									<p>During unit nine I posted the summary post regarding the accuracy of information Behavior after going over the posts done by my peers. We all agree both accuracy and ethics play a significant role when performing researches.</p>
									<p>I also worked on and completed the mandatory worksheet activities for unit nine, which I posted on my e-portfolio, I used the excel tool to complete these exercises. These activities were a bit more complex than the once from unit, but again these were as useful to learn for the future on a day-to-day basis or when doing research to present data.</p>
									<p>I continued working on the research proposal presentation. Doing the recordings along with creating the transcript to support the presentation. I might have accidently left out some of the items I talked about from the transcript as I was talking freely in the recordings and was not able to capture everything and also the word count would have exceeded if I added every single word to the transcript. </p>
									<p><b>Unit ten</b></p>
									<p>I submitted the research proposal presentation during this unit. </p>
									<p>Also started to consider the outline for the capstone project since this units’ lecture cast is talking about research writing.</p>
									<p><b>Unit eleven</b></p>
									<p>In this unit I have been mainly focusing on completing the e-portfolio and the reflection and getting all the artefacts on to my e-portfolio. The reflection is an area that I have struggled in the past modules also.  </p>
									<p><b>Unit twelve</b></p>
									<p>Completed the e-portfolio along with the transcript and will be submitted.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p><b>Word count = 1000</b></p>
