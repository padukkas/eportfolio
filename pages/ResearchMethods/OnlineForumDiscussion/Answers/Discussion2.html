										<h2>Discussion 2: Accuracy of information</h2>
									</header>
                                    <p>The following discussion will address the legal, social, and professional impacts of choices made by the researcher Abi in light of the given situation of reviewing nutritional value of a new cereal brand called Whizz.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p>Compared to other scientific research, nutritional research tends to have much more recognition within the public. Therefore, the accuracy of nutritional research reviews plays a significant role when it comes to the marketing of the specific product. As for an example, a few decades ago after reviewing several studies, researchers came into the conclusion that butter, which contained saturated fats are unhealthy for the human heart; as a result of that people shifted their diets by replacing butter with margarine. However, recent studies were able to identify margarine having trans fats is more harmful to the human heart than of using butter in diets. Likewise, nutritional research reviews have a significant impact on the public at large. (Boston and Ma, 2012).</p>
									<p></p>
									<p>Therefore, it is far more evident that scientific research reviews should present the truth; even truth being the complete opposite of what the researcher intended by the research. Same in the given scenario of researcher Abi; he should review the product, “Whizz cereal” without being biased to any condition. When reviewing the product, Abi, as the reviewer, should predict the types of bias that can impact the final outcome of his report and should draw conclusions without turning a blind eye to the scientific truth. As a result of nutritional studies being exaggerated in the media platforms, it is crucial to investigate similar studies along with used methodologies so as to derive the most logical and accurate results. Further, as the reviewer, Abi is entitled to conduct the review in an ethical manner and to forward the genuine results even if the results indicate negative impact on the manufacturer. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p>When it comes to the legal aspect, in states like Canada and USA adopt methods like examining the ethical concerns of a research and related reviewing processes through a certified board called, Research Ethics Board (REB) (Government of Canada, 2019). Further, legislations like Canadian Food and Drugs Act, Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act can be highlighted considering reviewing scientific truth relating to nutritional research.  </p>
