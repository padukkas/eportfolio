										<h2>Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p><b>Unit one</b></p>
									<p>During unit one for the initial post, I wanted to point out what I believe was some causes to why some projects fail. From experience lack of software testing (QA), poor decision making and lack of risk management causes some projects to fail. During Unit 1 seminar we went over different classes of project failures which helped understand the examples I mentioned earlier, also during the seminar we went over the final assessment.</p>
									<p><b>Unit two</b></p>
									<p>In unit two I responded to two of my peers’ initial posts. It is interesting see different view points others have on some of the same project failures but most pointed out issue I saw was lack of QA and poor communication in teams specially with upper management. During the seminar we went over the gherkin language and cucumber framework, which I have some experience in, since I work as a test automation developer where I use gherkins to write the test cases along with Selenium and cucumber.</p>
									<p><b>Unit three</b></p>
									<p>During unit three I posted the summary post regarding the project failures after going over the replies posted on my initial post as well as the posts done by my peers, which showed me how important proper project management is to the success of the overall project. </p>
									<p>We also attempted to have our first call with the other team to go over the requirements for the final assessment, as we only have communicated with them via email but it was difficult to arrange the time. We were able to get on a call with group 2 later that weekend to over the requirements.</p>
									<p><b>Unit four</b></p>
									<p>Unit four was really helpful when planning and developing the Project Report since we had to estimate resources, time, costs and risks. From work experience the famous saying under promise and over deliver. One of the approaches that was discussed during the seminar that I use at work is Agile approach (Planning Poker). </p>	
									<p>During this week we received the requirements from group 1 and we also finalized which requirements we will be accepting as the 10 required items.</p>
									<p><b>Unit five</b></p>
									<p>In this unit we focused on the concepts of user experience when developing a software. We have to make sure when developing an application how easy is it for the end user to complete their task on our application.</p>
									<p>During the unit I posed my initial post for the Discussion 2 where we discussed how human emotions can affect the user experience and how it can affect user satisfaction of the product over time. After completing the initial post something I learned was that complicated websites don’t attract customers but less complicated websites with good graphics attract customers.</p>
									<p>I also participated in the development of the draft document prior to sending it to the professor the review and give feedback to improve any areas we are lacking in. </p>
									<p><b>Unit six</b></p>
									<p>Unit six, we submitted the project report as part of the final product. We were able to apply feedback that we received for our draft from the professor to our final submission. </p>
									<p>During the seminar I learned about the Pytest unit testing framework. As an automation developer I have mainly used C#, .Net and typescript for automated testing. Tools like Pytest makes testing easier when using C# for example we have to build our framework to perform testing. </p>
									<p>During this unit I also completed the codio activity – pytest. The 5 tests that was in the script was initially passing since the assert was to verify the calculations were done properly. Since the tasks was to amend the code to fail the tests, I altered the values breaking the assert. </p>
									<p>We started the development process for the final project child game.</p>
									<p><b>Unit seven</b></p>
									<p>During unit seven I posted two replies to my peers’ posts. An interesting point I learned these posts was when a user gets used to and invest time learning one system they resist adapting to a new system. But how fast they adapt and how the individuals’ emotions play a role will all depend on user’s past experience with the previous system.</p>
									<p>I also submitted the findings and my response regarding the Components of User Experience model image posted. I learned that customer experience is one of the most important points for a project/application to be successful.</p>
									<p><b>Unit eight</b></p>
									<p>During unit eight I posted the summary post regarding how human emotions affect the user experience, which showed me how big of a role human emotions and habits play a role in them enjoying a product.</p>
									<p>The seminar helped me understand data structures further which we utilized for the final project where we used a list data structure. </p>
									<p><b>Unit nine</b></p>
									<p>For this units’ activity in my e-portfolio I have posted three strategies I used from the document in order to improve code quality. Three of the items mentioned I have used in the past but the style guide I have not used with other coding languages I have used in the past. </p>
									<p>I continued in the development process of the firebase portion of the final project while assisting other team members with issues that come up.</p>
									<p><b>Unit ten</b></p>
									<p>During this units codio activity I learned that PyLint is the best linter to catch errors and issues in my code. While pycodestyle and pydocstyle was useful to keep the styling and documentation in check. I have posted my findings in my e-portfolio.</p>
									<p>The seminar taught more of the QA validation and different quality models.</p>
									<p>Reflection on Software Quality e-portfolio activity was completed and posted as well where I compared two different articles regarding software quality from 1977, it was eye opening to see how far quality of software has come. </p>
									<p>Completed most of the project’s main components.</p>
									<p><b>Unit eleven</b></p>
									<p>Focus this week was to complete and tidy up some of the loose ends of the final submission along with the presentation deck. </p>
									<p><b>Unit twelve</b></p>
									<p>Completed the submission and had the presentation with the professor completing the project.</p>
